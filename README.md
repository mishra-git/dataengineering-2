# DATA MODELING IN APACHE CASSANDRA 
A startup Company called Sparkify  has data on songs and user activity in CSV files currently.  Any analytics on the data usage pattern has become a challange for the startup. They are looking for ways to improve their experrince. They are looking for a smart Data engineer to modeol their data using Apache Cassandra 

# PROJECT DETAIL 
This project is all about modeling the Sparkify data using Apache Cassandra. There are business questions the company has provided and we as data engineers have modeled their data using Cassandra 
so the company can use the models to answer thier questions in an easier way than to do in CSV files 

The data modeling requirements have been provided as series of queries and this modeling has been done as "Query first approach" 

# PROJECT DEVELOPMENT  AND SOLUTION 
The data for the project has been provided in CSV files  By Udacity. The developement and the final solution of the project are in
